Color Sorter
============

This example project makes the Color Sorter scan colored Technic beams using
the :class:`ColorSensor <pybricks.ev3devices.ColorSensor>`.

Scan the colored beams one by one and add them to the tray. A beep confirms
that it has registered the color. When the tray is full or when you press the
center button, the robot will start distributing the Technic bricks by color.
