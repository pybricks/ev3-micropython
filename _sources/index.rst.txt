Getting started with LEGO® MINDSTORMS Education EV3 MicroPython
===============================================================

This guide shows you how to get started writing MicroPython programs for your
LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 robots. You'll learn to do so in three steps:

- :doc:`Installation <startinstall>`: First you'll prepare your computer
  by collecting and installing the required tools. 
  
- :doc:`EV3 Brick <startbrick>`: Next, you'll learn to work with the EV3 Brick.

- :doc:`Creating and running programs <startrun>`: Finally, you'll learn how to
  create and run a programs.

After you've run the first demo program, you'll be ready to try out the example
programs and start inventing your own programs.

.. note::

   **EV3 MicroPython version v2.0 was released on May 18, 2020.**
